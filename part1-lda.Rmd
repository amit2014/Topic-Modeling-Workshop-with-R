```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
```

## Load the data

Let's start by loading our packages and loading the dataset.

```{r Load Data}
library(quanteda); library(tidyverse); library(RColorBrewer)

dataset <- read_csv("./articles-sample.csv")

#create corpus
myCorpus <- corpus(dataset$Abstract)
```

## Create the dfm (pre-processing)

First, we need to create a dfm (document-feature matrix) and remove a standard list of English stop words. 

We'll also remove sparse terms using the `trim` function.

```{r Pre-Processing}
dfm <- dfm(myCorpus,
           remove = c(stopwords("english")),
           ngrams=1L,
           stem = F,
           remove_numbers = TRUE, 
           remove_punct = TRUE,
           remove_symbols = TRUE)

vdfm <- dfm_trim(dfm, min_count = 10, min_docfreq = 5)
# min_count = remove words used less than x
# min_docfreq = remove words used in less than x docs
```

Let's explore the top 50 words.

```{r Top Features}
topfeatures(vdfm, n = 50)
```

Let's plot two word clouds: one with the raw term frequencies and one with TF-IDF.

```{r Word Clouds, warning=FALSE}
plot(vdfm,  scale=c(3.5, .75), colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"), 
     random.order = F, rot.per=0.1, max.words=250, main = "Raw Counts")
plot(tfidf(vdfm),  scale=c(3.5, .75), colors=brewer.pal(8, "Dark2"), 
     random.order = F, rot.per=0.1, max.words=250, main = "TF-IDF")
```

Let's now create a dendogram to get an idea of how the words are clustering.

```{r Clustering}
numWords <- 50

wordDfm <- sort(weight(vdfm, "tfidf"))
wordDfm <- t(wordDfm)[1:numWords,]  # keep the top numWords words
wordDistMat <- dist(wordDfm)
wordCluster <- hclust(wordDistMat)
plot(wordCluster, xlab="", main="TF-IDF Frequency weighting")
```

## Topic Modeling (LDA)

For the first part, we're going to use the `topicmodels` package to run LDA.

We're going to run Gibbs sampling which is a simulation based approach to LDA. There are multiple parameters we need to set.

The most important parameter is the number of topics. Usually, for your first time running topic modeling, there isn't a perfect number to start with. This is ok! Usually starting with 10 (hundred of documents) to 50 (tens of thousands of documents). Let's start with 20.

The second important parameter is the number of iterations. We'll set this as 500.

```{r LDA}
library(topicmodels)

# we now export to a format that we can run the topic model with
dtm <- convert(vdfm, to="topicmodels")

# estimate LDA with K topics
K <- 20
lda <- LDA(dtm, k = K, method = "Gibbs", 
                control = list(verbose=25L, seed = 123, burnin = 100, iter = 500))
```

## Visualizations Example: LDAVis

To explore our results, we'll use a Shiny-based interactive visualization called LDAvis. This has been prebuilt as a R package (FYI it's also available in Python). 

In order to use it, we'll need to convert our model results (in the `lda` object) to a json object that LDAVis requires as its input. That function is pre-loaded in the file `functions.R` within the repository. 

```{r LDAVis, results="hide"}
#Create Json for LDAVis
library(LDAvis)
source('./functions.R')
json <- topicmodels_json_ldavis(lda,vdfm,dtm)
new.order <- RJSONIO::fromJSON(json)$topic.order

# change open.browser = TRUE to automatically open result in browser
serVis(json, out.dir = 'unccResearch', open.browser = F)
```

Let's view the topics.

```{r}
term <- terms(lda, 10)

# Topic #'s reordered!!
term <- term[,new.order]
colnames(term) <- paste("Topic",1:K)
term
```

Like topics are probability distribution of words, in LDA documents are probability distributions of topics.  

Accordingly, we can rank the documents (papers) by how much they rank for each topic. In other words, 

First, let's extract the document-topic probability matrix.

```{r Doc-Topic Matrix}
# to get topic probabilities per document
postlist <- posterior(lda)
probtopics <- data.frame(postlist$topics)
probtopics <- probtopics[,new.order]
colnames(probtopics) <- paste("Topic",1:K)
```

Next, let's find the most representative document for Topic 1.

```{r Representative Docs}
filter.topic <- "Topic 1"

row <- order(-probtopics[,filter.topic])[1]
dataset$Abstract[row]
```

## Session Info

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
